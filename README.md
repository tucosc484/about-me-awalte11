## What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class? ##
I wouldn't really say I have anything I'd call a journey. I'd had fun messing around with game modding and programming a bit on the side while I was majoring in political science. When the Poli Sci major turned out to not be a thing I could make a career out of I turned to this because I had enjoyed programming and there's definitely a career to be had. I'd thought of going into the game industry, but I hear working conditions there tend to be terrible. 

As for this class in particular? Web development seems like a rather useful skill, and one with plenty of marketability.
## What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations? ##
I'd just like a stable job programming. Not management, not even leading a large team of programmers. I am much better with machines than people. 
## What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience? ##
I don't have any web experience. Plenty of time working with Java, a bit of C#, some with Lua. No professional experience, all classes and doing my own thing.
